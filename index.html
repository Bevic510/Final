<p>At 120 Essex Street in the Lower East Side stands the Essex Street Market, where it has stood for seventy-five years. In 2018, the market will move to the Essex Crossing development, which will give it new life while still providing the same things for the residents of the community that it has served for years, as well as providing new things for tourists and people new to the area. </p>

<p>The Essex Street Market, located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, is surrounded by a neighborhood rich in diversity, a virtual melting pot of culture and flavor. Mayor Fionello La Guardia, who was known for building these types of markets all over the city, created this specific market to move street vendors into a safer place. The market thrived for years and although it experienced hardship for two decades between 1970 and 1990, almost facing closure, the market persevered and remained a staple in the community. </p>

<p>Throughout the market’s colorful and bustling halls, there are banners that boast “75 Years and Still Fresh,” a claim that is backed up by their customer’s opinions.</p>
 <p>“I always come here for the fish, even though I could easily just go to Whole Foods,” said James Woodrow, who had stopped in to pick up groceries for dinner. “It’s just a lot better here.” </p>

<p>Being around as long as it has, The Essex Street Market has changed with the growth of the neighborhood, offering new things for its customers and adding more things for them to experience. There are organic, Brooklyn grown coffee shops, fish markets and other fresh, homemade products being sold, alongside grocery stores which offer a variety of products that aren’t available in regular supermarkets and a vendor who sells different types of religious artifacts. The twenty-eight vendors that make up the market and give it it’s unique charm are not just from New York, but from The Dominican Republic, Mexico, Sweden, Japan, and all different parts of the world. </p>

<p>Those same vendors will be moving with the market when it migrates to the new Essex Crossing in 2018, where it will now hold 38 vendors, and all previous vendors will be compensated for their moving costs. Essex Crossing will not be completed until 2024, but the $1.9 billion development will offer low-middle income apartments, a movie theater, a bowling alley, and cultural spaces, meant for lectures, cooking classes art installations and more. The market has always focused on the community that it served, and now sets its sights on tourism. </p>

<p>“I think it will be great for the community, give families a safe place to go,” says Ramona Cordero, who is a frequent shopper at the Essex Street Market. </p>

<p>The New York City Economic Development Corporation’s decision to move the market not only comes from its desire to bring in more tourism, but because they believe that it makes sense with the direction that the neighborhood is heading. There has been an influx of newcomers to the area that bring with them different tastes and different appetites for entertainment. 
The neighborhoods demographic has shifted over the last couple years, with higher income families moving in the area, and higher priced living spaces being made available, as well as a rise in tourists coming to the Lower East Side due to its art community growth and the market wants to remain loyal to their usual customers, while also providing new things for those who are moving into the neighborhood. </p>

<p>The market wants to make the establishment an enticing place for those people to enjoy, which will be monitored by a community advisory committee to ensure the quality of the programs and shops being offered. The Economic Development Committee is also providing funding for a full-time manager to oversee events and community outreach.
Christine Juritsch, owner of Peasant Stock, a quaint shop that offers soup and bakery products all made daily in house, said that even though they are moving to a new location, the rent remains subsidized by the city and is less than the standard of the area.</p>
 <p>“The market offers good quality food to a diverse group of people,” she said. “I think it gives customers a sense of community, and is very welcoming to a diverse group of people.”</p></h3>

<p><h1>Protesters of Art Exhibit Say Chinatown is Not For Sale</h1></p>

<p>Outside of an art gallery on the Lower East Side in Manhattan, signs read, “CHINATOWN IS NOT FOR SALE” and “CHINATOWN LIVES ARE NOT POVERTY PORN!,” marks of the disdain for a recent exhibit.</p>

<p>The work in question, an installation at the James Cohan Art Gallery, was met with criticism by some in the community who felt the work was racially and culturally insensitive.</p>



<p>The exhibition titled, “August” by artist Omer Fast, according to the artist’s note inside the gallery, was intended to show “the passage of time” in turning the gallery space back into a storefront from a few years ago. Fast converted the glass-walled gallery lobby into a Chinese-owned corner store, his with broken ATM machines, neon lottery signs, dim lighting, cracked plastic chairs, paper lanterns strung about the small room, and an old television, crackling with static, in a corner on the ceiling. The exhibit also includes a related short film.</p>



<p>Fast wrote that his intention was to bring light to the influx of art galleries that push out families and business owners. The Chinatown Art Brigade, a non-profit organization, has taken responsibility for some of the protest signs and rallies at the gallery, along with a letter-writing campaign to the gallery, asking for the installation to be removed.</p>

<p>Tomie Arai, an artist and co-founder of The Chinatown Art Brigade, agrees with Fast in saying that the rise of rent has displaced low-income tenants and made way for the art galleries and high-priced condominiums in the neighborhood. Arai also said that several mom-and-pop businesses have been shuttered because of evictions. “Many have served the Chinatown community for decades,” Arai said.</p>

<p>Between 2006 and 2016, according to the Furman Center, the median rent in the Chinatown area increased more than 240%, to $3,150 per month. Sale prices for property in the community also increased, by 13.4% between 2015 and 2016, compared to 2.8% citywide.</p>

<p>The James Cohan Gallery opened in 2015. Its recent exhibits include Ethiopian artist Elias Sime’s “Twisted and Hidden,” and Brooklyn-based artist Amy Feldman’s “Nerve Reserve.”</p>

<p>Fast said of his “August” work, in a statement released by the gallery, that “strong reactions – positive and negative – reinforces the paradox it is trying to capture.”</p>

<p>“His intention wasn’t to create offense when he created the installation,” said Jeffrey Waldron, associate director of the gallery. “We are committed to welcoming discussion around it, respecting their right to protest. Per the artist’s request, we are keeping the posters up on the exterior.”</p>

<p>“I saw all their signs and how they all said how bad the gallery is,” said Ethan Ling, who works at the Da Hing Florist, located across the street from the art gallery. “The exhibit is bad,” Ling said. “It’s good that they’re protesting.” Ling, who watched some of the protests, said he will be happy when the exhibit closes.</p>





<p>The protest signs for now remain a de facto part of the exhibit.</p>

<p>“It is not our job to tell the James Cohan Gallery what to do,” said Arai. “It’s on them to figure out how to respond appropriately.”</p></h3>
